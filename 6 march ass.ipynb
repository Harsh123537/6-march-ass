    "Descriptive statistics involves the analysis of data to summarize and describe its main characteristics such as central tendency, variability, and distribution. Descriptive statistics can be used to provide a clear and concise summary of data, which can help in understanding and interpreting the data. Examples of descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and frequency distribution. For instance, if a researcher wants to describe the average height of a group of people, they would use descriptive statistics such as mean or median to summarize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics involves making inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. Inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses, make predictions, and draw conclusions about a population. Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, regression analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and confidence intervals. For instance, if a researcher wants to test whether a new drug is effective in treating a particular disease, they would use inferential statistics such as hypothesis testing to make a conclusion about the effectiveness of the drug based on a sample of patients."

    "Nominal level of measurement: Variables at the nominal level of measurement are categorical and can only be classified into distinct groups or categories.

Ordinal variables are characterized by the presence of an order, but the difference between categories is not the same. Examples of ordinal variables include ranking (first/second/third), Likert scales (strongly agree/agree/neutral/disagree/strongly disagree), or education level (high school diploma/bachelor's degree/master's degree).\n",

    "Interval level of measurement: Variables at the interval level of measurement are numerical and have a meaningful distance between the values, but there is no true zero point. Interval variables are characterized by the presence of an equal interval between values, but there is no meaningful zero point. Examples of interval variables include temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit, or dates measured on the calendar.\n",

    "Ratio level of measurement: Variables at the ratio level of measurement are numerical and have a meaningful absolute zero point, which allows for meaningful ratios between values. Ratio variables are characterized by the presence of an absolute zero point, which represents the absence of the measured attribute. Examples of ratio variables include height, weight, or income."
